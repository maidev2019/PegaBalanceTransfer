# PegaBalanceTransfer
Developed a Pega app that allows customers to transfer outstanding balances from other credit cards to a UPlus Bank credit card.


## Scenario
U-Plus wants to allow customers to transfer outstanding balances from other credit cards to a U-Plus credit card to encourage customers to consolidate financial services needs with U-Plus Bank. U-Plus offers several balance transfer options, with variations in up-front fees, promotional interest rates, and promotional offer length.
Customers can begin a balance transfer by calling a call center, where a customer service representative (CSR) walks the customer through the balance transfer. When the CSR begins the balance transfer process, the account number is passed to the balance transfer case to present users with the account information.
After providing an account number, customers select one of the available balance transfer offers, identify the amount to transfer from one or more credit cards, and review the terms of the balance transfer offer. The case is then routed to a CSR work queue. A CSR either approves or rejects the transfer. If the transfer is rejected, the CSR identifies the reason for the rejection. After the transfer is approved or rejected, customers receive an email about the decision.
For MLP 1 of the balance transfer project, CSRs interact with the application through the user portal channel. For MLP 2, customers can access the application directly through a mobile app and receive guidance from a web chatbot.
While you want to plan for MLP 1 and MLP 2, you are implementing the functionality described in MLP 1 only.Â
